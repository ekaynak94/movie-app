# Movie App üé¨

This is a mobile movie app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/), allowing users to search for movies, view details, and save their favorite movies. The app leverages the [Movie Database Alternative API](https://rapidapi.com/rapidapi/api/movie-database-alternative) for fetching movie data.

The UI design is influenced by [this file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1054431643740926668)
